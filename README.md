Statement:
Finding the harmonic balance solution of a non linear harmonically excited system using FFT.(matlab or python) and comparing it to 
to the closed form solution of the system.

We shall start with a linear undamped system and then extend the procedure for a non linear system .

softwares : matlab,python.

Theory :
The harmonic balance method solves for the particular solution of the system.
(A non homogenous system has two parts in its solution/response. : 1.Homogenous/steady state solution 2. non homogenous/particular soltn)
So in this case the response includes only the non homogenous solution part.

Let us assume a linear system of the form x''+x=sin(wt) initially.
